    "Developing high-quality questions and procuring answers to these questions is not only fundamental to learning and information gathering, but to scientific and progress as a whole. Online question-answer communities and fora have given internet-users the unprecendented ability of presenting questions to the world, and while much attention has been given to finding the right answers (ask Google), relatively little attention has been dedicated to how we can improve questions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Having users produce relevant, legible and previously-researched questions is particularly valuable in communities where expert resources are often scarce. One way in which to promote this would be to **predict a question's quality/community engagement so that users can be nudged to improve aspects of their questions before adding demand to the community.** With this end-goal in mind, this analysis explores a group of **large online question-answer communities**... **critiques, validates and extends the methodology in previous research that has been focused on questions in question-answer communities.** By harnessing the capability of distributed cloud computing, I am able to analyse datasets much larger than what is capable by a single, commercial laptop."

    "This is a common theme throughout the analysis with PySpark commands failing if there aren't enough cores on the master worker. Initially it was thought that this was due to the original data being stored in XML format [as this appears to be an issue in some cases](https://community.hortonworks.com/questions/78024/comdatabrickssparkxml-parsing-xml-takes-a-very-lon.html), but my hypothesis is that the underlying Spark installation beneath PySpark is having trouble using the cores across the master and workers effectively, resulting in very high computation times for basic queries on very small datasets. While much was tried to address this problem, it remained throughout the analysis and hence why not all 10 largest StackExchange datasets (let alone 20) were analysed. Nevertheless, this notebook allows for the reproducibility of the analysis with larger datasets if this particular obstacle is overcome."

    "Developing high-quality questions and procuring answers to these questions is not only fundamental to learning and information gathering, but to scientific progress as a whole. Online question-answer communities and fora have given internet-users the unprecendented ability of presenting questions to the world, and while much attention has been given to finding the right answers (ask Google), relatively little attention has been dedicated to how we can improve questions. This project explores over 1.2 million answers and questions from five of the largest StackExchange communities using distributed cloud computing technologies and uses natural language processing to uncover linguistic aspects of these answers and questions."

A number of dedicated question-answer communities also exist to directly and more rigorously answer the swarm of the world's daily questions, some of which include [Quora](quora.com), [Yahoo! Answers](answers.yahoo.com) and the family of dedicated fora, [StackExchange](https://stackexchange.com/sites#traffic).\n",

This aim of this project therefore is an initial exploratory analysis of data on over 1.2 million answers and questions from various StackExchange fora relating to a variety of subject matter. Most importantly, by harnessing the capability of distributed cloud computing I am able to analyse datasets far larger than what is capable on a single, commercial machine.\n",

    "The layout of the analysis is as follows: Firstly and secondly I give a brief discussion of the distributed computing technologies and data analysed. This is followed by an illustration of the setup code and the specific architecture of the computing capabilities I used. Various aspects of the data are then explored via Exploratory Data Analysis and t-SNE graphs, as well as through a Latent Dirichlet Allocation model that is implemented on post content to investigate latent topics and underlying semantic structure across each forum. Lastly, I conclude with a discussion on recommended further research."

    "[Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org) is a cluster-computing framework that is open-source and designed for to be fault-tolerant, distributed and use in-memory computing. [Apache Hadoop](http://hadoop.apache.org) is the distributed data storage and processing software framework underlying Spark, which uses the MapReduce programming model. The two main components of Hadoop are Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) and YARN. HDFS is the distributed file system handling large data, whereas YARN separates resource management and processing components.\n",

    "While the driver and each executor run their own Java processes, the main method (SparkContext) runs on the driver process. The executors are processes on worker nodes that run individual tasks for a given Spark job - they launch at the beginning of a Spark initiation and will generally run until it ends. When tasks are completed, the executors relay results back to the driver.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fundamental core class in Spark is the Resilient Distributed Dataset (RDD), put forth by Zaharia *et al.* (2012). RDDs are the distributed memory abstraction that allow programmers to use in-memory computation on large machine clusters in a fault tolerant way. The main finding from Zaharia *et al.* (2012) is that keeping data in-memory results improved performance by orders of magnitude.\n",

The Spark SQL module incorporates relational processing in Spark and thus benefits from optimised storage and declarative queries, as well as lets Structured Query Language (SQL) users use a host of analytics libraries in Spark (Armbrust *et al.*, 2015).\n",

Users can upload their own datasets easily since BigQuery is integrated with Google Drive, Google Cloud BigTable and Google Cloud Storage. There are also a number of [public datasets](https://cloud.google.com/public-datasets/), one of which is the largest StackExchange question-answer site, StackOverflow.

While this may indicate resource bottlenecking on the master CPUs, a much more likely explanation is that the full capacity of the cores of the master and workers is not being used when issuing PySpark commands, and htop provides evidence for this:"

    "This is a common theme throughout the initial analysis with PySpark commands failing if there weren't enough cores on the master worker. It was originally thought that this was due to the original data being stored in XML format [as this appears to be an issue in some cases](https://community.hortonworks.com/questions/78024/comdatabrickssparkxml-parsing-xml-takes-a-very-lon.html), but it is also possible that the underlying Spark installation beneath PySpark is having trouble using the cores across the master and workers effectively resulting in very high computation times for data read-in and basic queries on relatively small datasets. While much troubleshooting was undergone to address this problem, it remained throughout most of the analysis and consequently not all 10 largest StackExchange datasets (let alone 20) were analysed. Nevertheless, this notebook allows for the reproducibility of the analysis with larger datasets if this particular issue is addressed."

    "A graph further left is indicative of low `ViewCounts` per post and corresponds to the `ViewCount` bar graph displayed above - this is evident since `es_stackoverflow` is furthest left whereas `unix` and `codegolf` are furthest right. \n",

    "The crossings of the curves indicate that there are certain `ViewCount` thresholds where forums become more popular (experience more viewing traffic) than others. For example, for low `ViewCount` posts between 100 and just over 1000, the `codegolf` forum has the highest views per post, but after a certain point the `unix` forum appears to have more popular posts. This also shows that there are particular posts in the `unix` forum that are very highly viewed, most likely because they hold much utility to individuals working and programming in unix environments. Interestingly though, the same curve shape does not hold for `es_stackoverflow` where we would assume particular posts would also have high-value to the community.\n",

    "It appears that there is substantial heterogeneity across the fora, owing to the results from the EDA and LDA perplexity and likelihood results. It is highly recommended that further analysis split the posts into questions and answers respectively to repeat the analysis to see differences across these two classes.\n",

    "Further research could address the computation difficulties when reading in and querying the data by exploring the following:\n",
